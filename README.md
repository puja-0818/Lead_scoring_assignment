# Lead_scoring_assignment

Objective
X Education, an online course provider, wants to improve its lead conversion rate, which is currently around 30%. The goal is to build a logistic regression model to score leads between 0-100, helping the sales team focus on 'Hot Leads'â€”those most likely to convert. By identifying these leads, the company hopes to increase conversion efficiency. The model should also be flexible to adapt to future changes in the company's requirements.
